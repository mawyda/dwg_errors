birth errors 

Q?: Should you keep old functions in code, or just remove?


parts, dwg_errors, dwg_details


write a read me
test that this all still works.
create dummy html
create dummy svgs.

refactor and clean up.
- remove anything stating that this is birth. 
- file locations might be an issue as well.
